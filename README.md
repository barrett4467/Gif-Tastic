# Gif-Tastic

Gif-Tastic is an application built on HTML and CSS that relies on ajax and jQuery to display gifs at the press of a button. The application reaches out to the giphy API and displays 10 results related to the button pressed. Users can add additional buttons by simply inputting a term into the search field. The gifs start paused, but when clicked, begin to play.
